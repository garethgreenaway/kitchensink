OpenPhoto / Webhook / ASCII Art Email
=======================
#### A webhook script to email ASCII art of your photos

### About this hack

This is a hack to show what can be done with the [OpenPhoto webhook API][https://github.com/openphoto/frontend/blob/master/documentation/api/PostWebhookSubscribe.markdown].

By subscribing to the _photo.upload_ topic you can specify a callback URL which gets POSTed to each time a new photo is uploaded.
